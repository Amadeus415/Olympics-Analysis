# Olympics-Analysis

We do an analysis of two Olympics Dataset. We perform the following analysis:
1. Identify the three tallest olympians
2. Map the distribution of height in the olympics
3. What cities have the most olympians?
4. What olympians have the most medals?
5. Graph top medals holders
6. Plot a heatmap showing which countries have the most medals.

    Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repository` with the name of your repository.

4. Change into the cloned repository directory:

    ```
    cd your-repository
    ```

5. Create a virtual environment using `venv`:

      ```
      python3 -m venv venv
      ```

    - On Windows:

      ```
      python -m venv venv
      ```

6. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On macOS and Linux:

      ```
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    - On Windows:

      ```
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

7. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
